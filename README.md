Minimal django project in support of [django ticket 24506](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/24506).
---

This repository contains two django projects using different django versions and is a working example that the django ticket 24506 has been fixed in django 1.8.

1. `Proxyuser17` uses django 1.7 which breaks when migrating as per ticket 24506.
2. `Proxyuser18` uses django 1.8 using the same models and it doesn't break.

### Fixing  migration manually when using django 1.7

There is a way to fix migration generated by django 1.7. You need to amend the migration file that changes foreign key.

In the example project the change would be in `/proxyuser17/apps/myapp/migrations/0002_auto_20150322_1127.py` from:

```python

    dependencies = [
        ('myapp', '0001_initial'),
    ]

```

to:

```python

    dependencies = [
        ('myapp', '0001_initial'),
        ('core', '0001_initial')
    ]

```

The change adds migration that creates proxy models as a dependency.
